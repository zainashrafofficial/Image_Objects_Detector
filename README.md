# Objects Detection in Image
Objects of Image Detection using Python, YOLO and OpenCV. This is the project which i have created just for fun and an assigned task to me from my office colleague, i had no expderience of python before this, i am new to python, as i have experience in Web Apps and Websites. But, this i accepted this challenge and create my first python project of <b>Objects Detection in Image</b>. I created it in just a one day using AI and my creativity.

## Steps to Run this Application
<ul>
  <li>
    Python Installed and also Included in Environment Variables.
  </li>
  <li>
    OpenCV, Python's Library which you can install using command: "pip install opencv-python"
  </li>
  <li>
    Yolo, YOLO is a object detection algorithm which stand for You Only Look Once. I've implemented the algorithm in Python using pre-trained weights using YOLO. You can install it using command: "pip install yolo"
  </li>
</ul>

You can use pretrained models for image objects detection as a beginner, Pre-trained Models are the most common and beginner-friendly approach. You can use pre-trained models like YOLOv5, SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), or Faster R-CNN with libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. These models are already trained on large datasets and can detect various objects.
